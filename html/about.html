        <h2>About Us</h2><br>
        <h4>Welcome to the best flower shop chain in the country! </h4><br>
        <p>In 1967, in a small colony in the north
          of the country, the first store was established by Israel Hasbani. So married to Rina and father
          to Yoram and Sharona. The store was established with a lot of love and respect for the plant and
          its beauty. Since then our flower shops have supplied hundreds of thousands of flowers and
          plants to all the inhabitants of the country, who came from all over its ends. Grandpa Israel's
          legacy continues to this day by his grandchildren Danny and Sean. Come join our thriving and
          flourishing family!</p>
